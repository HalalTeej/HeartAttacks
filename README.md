This project was set for us to design an Artificial Neural Network Machine Learning Algorithm to help predict the likelihood of an individual to have a heart attack.
Estimations were based on parameters such as age, race, BMI, familial history, caloric intake, exercise, etc.
Regression and classification models were created useing SKLearn and KERAS archives.
